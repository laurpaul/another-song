That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again) Remember when he used to be a rascal? Oh
Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Drowning
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your weight
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby you're electric love
Baby you're electric electric
Take me to your best friend's house
Roll around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
Take me to your best friend's house
Normally we're making out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party; pillow fight
My eyes and your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats till beddy-bye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't kiss me goodnight

Don't
Don't leave me tongue tied

Don't
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you
So why don't we just move into the other room
There's space for us to shake and hey, I like this tune
Even if I could hear what you said
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear
Because I haven't read a single book all year
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
The music's too loud, and the noise from the crowd
Increases the chance of misinterpretation
So let your hips do the talking
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
Take me up tight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
and if I betray our lonely nights spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we ever fight when I'm away?
Did your mother always seem to hate me?
I'm sicker every day and now I'm terrified of talking to my friends only to stay still
Dreaming of our first born and your hair covered in popcorn
You never leave
You never leave
You never leave
You leave me up tight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
and if I betray our lonely nights spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we ever fight when I'm away?
We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds to
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste yeah
These hearts adore,
Every other beat the other one beats for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold,
It's too cold
The holes of my sweater
Here's to Julian, a man among a million others
Turned his back upon it all
Raise another glass then smash it up into its fragments
Walking barefoot on the ground
And as I fall into the bottle bank (broken glass)
You can make me into anything
As long as I'm reflecting you
Don't let this love
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Sing to Emily, make her laugh and talk her accent
See the colour in her eyes
Then I'll take her palm and joke about a life together
Lying, smoking on the ground
And as I fall into the bottle bank (broken glass)
You can make me into anything
As long as I'm reflecting you
Don't let this love
I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Every moment (every moment)
Always like this (always like this)
We got our come ups (we got our come ups)
And you ?
Lonely is your love
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
We could walk to the city bars
We could swing to Americana
I don't need much don't make a difference
Just take me dancing
We could walk to the shitty bars
We could swing to Americana
I don't need much don't make a difference
Just take me dancing

To fall down at your door

And when the money, comes in for the work I do

Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when its bright
Well, this Decemer, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a little bit lonely in this home its always
Colder on your own, my darling
I
I let the seasons change my mind
Only in my darkest moments
I wanna see you with your head wide open
Empty on the ground, gone without a sound
Just another white elm growing at the end of town
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
Well I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a little bit lonely in this home
It's always colder on your own
My darling I
I let the seasons change my mind
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a bit
Maybe this December I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
God knows I do
We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
I can hear it in your voice while your speaking you can't be treated
Mr. Know it all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
He told me I should take it in
Listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older I can hear the way their creaking
As their holding him
Well I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to me that every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
I can tell the wires pulled
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel but he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds ohh
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, woah, woah, woah
I said no, I said no
Listen close, It's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
Because there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook."
Ha!
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine
No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
We're taking over the world
A little victimless crime
And when I'm taking your innocence
I'll be corrupting your mind
No need to cry
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
(Do it all the time)
Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
It's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time
Ha!
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine
I'm making her mine
No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
(Do it all the time)
Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
And it's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
I don't wanna do it, but I'll do it
'Cause I do it all the time
Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
It's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from here
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense is controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through?
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
It might come true (run run ooo)
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Good night, oh baby
Sleep tight, oh baby
Good night, oh baby
Sleep tight, oh baby
If you feel lonely
I could be lonely with you
Tell me, baby
Why do you seem so blue?
Why are we so complicated?
Maybe love is overrated
I'm tired of waiting
I was never good at sports
Save the games for the girls on the tennis court
Say you need me
But lately, you feel unsure
Come on to me, come on to me
I need more
If you feel broken
Promise I won't break your heart
If you shatter
I won't let you fall apart
Why are we so complicated?
Love's a word I've always hated
I'm tired of waiting
I was never good at sports
Save the games for the girls on the tennis court
Say you need me
But lately, you feel unsure
Come on to me, come on to me
I need more
It always feels like
I need more
Jesus Christ, you're so confusing
If we keep score
Bet my money that I'm losing
Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down, I'll carry you home
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got, I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a tab
'Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)
The world is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight
Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive and the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm having a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't want to stop at all
Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine, ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh explode
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh ooh ooh, I like it
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ah
Oh yeah
Alright
Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time (wooh)
Just give me a call (alright)
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm having a good time, yeah yeah)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't want to stop at all
La da da da daah
Da da da haa
Ha da da ha ha haaa
Ha da daa ha da da aaa
Ooh ooh ooh
I can't speak and I can't listen
And everyone is a curse or something worse
What can I say to the kid that made you
Complain and lie you were made to
When you hate every god I pray to
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I'd like to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
I've gone weak and I'm sick of speaking
So hear me out you're the cure or something more
I think you're one of a kind so I'll never like myself
I think you're older and wiser so I won't let you tell
I think it over and over and hope you're thinking too
I think it over and over and hope I'm over you
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
Everyone, I messed up again
Everyone, I messed up again ohh
Everyone, I messed up again
Everyone, I messed up again
Ohhh
So don't lie to me
I know I'm not as cool as I try to be
But why do you feel so down, again?
I know I'm not a very good friend
Why do you feel so down?
Sure, that's not something I'd stick around for
Why do you feel so down?
Oh God, I know you think I'm safe and sound, I'm not
Why do you feel so down?
Why do you feel so down?
She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try
I wanna grow old before I grow up
I wanna die with my chin up
And definitely maybe I will live to love
Definitely maybe I will live to love
Heart and soul
Never know
Heart and soul
I wanna shine before I show up
I wanna die with my chin up
And definitely maybe I will live to love
Definitely maybe I will live to love
Heart and soul
Never know
Heart and soul
Never know
And I can tell by the look in your eyes
You didn't know the way
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young (repeat)
It takes all my time to be in love with you
It takes all of my time, what do I do?
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young
All die young
Love is lovely when you are young (repeat)
