Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
All my past lives they got nothing on me
Golden eagle you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky
I'll take you way back, countless centuries
Don't you remember that you were meant to be
My Queen of Hearts, meant to be my love
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Passing seasons, empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love
Diamond sparrow, my moonlit majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothing funny
Just to talk
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you
