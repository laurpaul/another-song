Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
All my past lives they got nothing on me
Golden eagle you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky
I'll take you way back, countless centuries
Don't you remember that you were meant to be
My Queen of Hearts, meant to be my love
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Passing seasons, empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love
Diamond sparrow, my moonlit majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothing funny
Just to talk
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seemed
My love, when you dream them up
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now, when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a Mecca Dauber or a betting pencil?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seemed
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Oh oh
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just soundin' it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not coming back again
You used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
Is everything as pretty as the past though?
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again)
Remember when he used to be a rascal? Oh
Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Drowning
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your weight
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby you're electric love
Baby you're electric electric
Take me to your best friend's house
Roll around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
Take me to your best friend's house
Normally we're making out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party; pillow fight
My eyes and your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats till beddy-bye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't
Take me to your best friend's house
Roll around this roundabout
Oh yeah
