Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feeling
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
All my past lives they got nothing on me
Golden eagle you're the one and only flying high
Through the cities in the sky
I'll take you way back, countless centuries
Don't you remember that you were meant to be
My Queen of Hearts, meant to be my love
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Swear to the moon, the stars, the sons and the daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Passing seasons, empty bottles of wine
My ancient kingdom came crashing down without you
Baby child, I'm lost without your love
Diamond sparrow, my moonlit majesty
You know I need you, come flying back to me
Through all of my lives
I'd never thought I'd wait so long for you
The timing is right
The stars are aligned
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
I need you now, I've waited oh so long, yeah
(Gimme love)
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
So save that heart for me
'Cause girl you know that you're my destiny (d-destiny)
Respect to the moon, the stars, their sons and their daughters
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
Save that heart for me
And girl I'll give you everything you need (everything you need)
Here's to our past lives, our mothers and fathers
Our love is deeper than the oceans of water
I need you now, I've waited oh so long
Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothing funny
Just to talk
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seemed
My love, when you dream them up
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now, when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a Mecca Dauber or a betting pencil?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seemed
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Oh oh
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just soundin' it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not coming back again
You used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
Is everything as pretty as the past though?
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again)
Remember when he used to be a rascal? Oh
Candy
She's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Drowning
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your weight
And every night my mind is running around her
Then it's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
All I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby, you're electric love
Electric love
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby you're electric love
Baby you're electric electric
Take me to your best friend's house
Roll around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
Take me to your best friend's house
Normally we're making out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't
One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party; pillow fight
My eyes and your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats till beddy-bye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't
Take me to your best friend's house
Roll around this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you
So why don't we just move into the other room
There's space for us to shake and hey, I like this tune
Even if I could hear what you said
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear
Because I haven't read a single book all year
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
The music's too loud, and the noise from the crowd
Increases the chance of misinterpretation
So let your hips do the talking
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you
Take me up tight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
and if I betray our lonely nights spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we ever fight when I'm away?
Did your mother always seem to hate me?
I'm sicker every day and now I'm terrified of talking to my friends only to stay still
Dreaming of our first born and your hair covered in popcorn
You never leave
You never leave
You never leave
You leave me up tight
Strung up like a kite
Dumb, wicked, and white
Love me in spite
and if I betray our lonely nights spent out like a light
With no kiss goodnight
Would we ever fight when I'm away?
We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds to
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste yeah
These hearts adore,
Every other beat the other one beats for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no no
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here
And now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
'Cause it's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold whoa
For you here and now
So let me hold whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold,
It's too cold
The holes of my sweater
Here's to Julian, a man among a million others
Turned his back upon it all
Raise another glass then smash it up into its fragments
Walking barefoot on the ground
And as I fall into the bottle bank (broken glass)
You can make me into anything
As long as I'm reflecting you
Don't let this love
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Sing to Emily, make her laugh and talk her accent
See the colour in her eyes
Then I'll take her palm and joke about a life together
Lying, smoking on the ground
And as I fall into the bottle bank (broken glass)
You can make me into anything
As long as I'm reflecting you
Don't let this love
I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Every moment (every moment)
Always like this (always like this)
We got our come ups (we got our come ups)
And you ?
Lonely is your love
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
Lonely ain't enough
Well I could be the answer to
All of your prayers
Take me dancing
We could walk to the city bars
We could swing to Americana
I don't need much don't make a difference
Just take me dancing
We could walk to the shitty bars
We could swing to Americana
I don't need much don't make a difference
Just take me dancing
When I wake up, well I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next you
When I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be

If I get drunk, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver up, yeah I know I'm gonna be

But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walks a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
When I'm working, yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money, comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you
When I come home (when I come home) well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow-old (when I grow-old) well I know I'm gonna be

To fall down at your door

I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
When I go out (when I go out) well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
And when I come home (when I come home) yes I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you

Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when it's bright
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
Only in my darkest moments can I see the light
I think I'm prone to getting blinded when its bright
Well, this Decemer, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a little bit lonely in this home its always
Colder on your own, my darling
I
I let the seasons change my mind
Only in my darkest moments
I wanna see you with your head wide open
Empty on the ground, gone without a sound
Just another white elm growing at the end of town
Well, this December, I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
Oooh
God knows I do
Well I'm alright if you're alright
And I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a little bit lonely in this home
It's always colder on your own
My darling I
I let the seasons change my mind
I'm alright if you're alright
I'm okay if you're okay
It's this state, in this state I'm living in
It's just a little bit
It's just a bit
Maybe this December I'll remember
Want you to see it when I do
God knows I do
We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
I can hear it in your voice while your speaking you can't be treated
Mr. Know it all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
He told me I should take it in
Listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older I can hear the way their creaking
As their holding him
Well I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to me that every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
I can tell the wires pulled
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel but he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming
If he said help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Straight to hell
Straight to hell
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds ohh
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, woah, woah, woah
I said no, I said no
Listen close, It's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
Because there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook."
Ha!
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine
No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
We're taking over the world
A little victimless crime
And when I'm taking your innocence
I'll be corrupting your mind
No need to cry
I'm only doing anything I want to do
Because I do it all the time
(Do it all the time)
Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
It's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
Get your money from a trust fund
Do it all the time
Ha!
We're taking over the world
One kiss at a time
And then I'm taking your girl
And I'm making her mine
I'm making her mine
No reason why
I'm only doing anything I want to do
(Do it all the time)
Now we're so young
But we're probably gonna die
And it's so fun
We're so good at selling lies
We look so good
And we never even try
I don't wanna do it, but I'll do it
'Cause I do it all the time
Now we're so young
